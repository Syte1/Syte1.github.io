Move your avatar around the map using W,A,S,D controls and run into a cow to feed it. The faster you feed it, the more coins you get! Beware of nasty surprises if you don't feed a cow in time. As the game progresses, cows will spawn faster and faster. Try and feed them all!",

The data is then converted in to a text file which then goes to the ai_answers module, where the OpenAI works on the collected data and provides suitable answers to the questions. Finally, the discord bot is used a user interface to ask and answer the questions.",
