Hi, I'm Belal, a Canadian-born software developer with 3 years of professional experience, and 4 years of educational experience.

I graduated from the British Columbia Institute of Technology's Computer Systems Technology (CST) Co-op program with a specialty in cloud-computing.

I've been a bit of a tech nerd my whole life. I love to turn ideas into projects with practical purposes, and am very motivated to find solutions to any problems that present themselves along the way. I have excellent communication skills and am very open-minded, especially when it comes to approaching problems in different ways.
:)
