I'm a competitive software developer based in Vancouver, BC with a passion for technology, improvement, and problem solving. I'm very experienced in fullstack development, have professional experience in backend development, and often work on projects for fun.

I am currently in my final year in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology diploma program, specializing in Cloud, and will graduate in December 2023.

I've been messing around with computers as far as I can remember, and further. That passion for tech only grew, and somewhere down the line I realised I wanted to get into software development. In between, I streamed League of Legends,
where I repeatedly ranked #1 Ryze worldwide and among the top 0.2% of players. My obsession with improvement has followed me throughout my whole life. Even outside of tech, about 5 years ago, I started playing piano for the first time and have been self-learning ever since. Today, I can play any songs from games or animes by ear.
